<h1>Hi There</h1>
<h2>This was an assignment by Fundit</h2>
<p>I'm not ashamed to admit that it wasn't enough for them and I got rejected. Then I decided to take it as a challenge and improve the code. I put a lot of work into refactoring the react code into small components, and the backend into small files which each file has its responsibility.</p>
<h2>Benfits</h2>
<h3>What I gained from putting extra work in that assignment</h3>

   </li>

   Working with CSS which I'm not used to
   </li>
</ol>
